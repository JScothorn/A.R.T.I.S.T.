                    <h1>Birth Defects</h1>
                        <p>The risk of birth defects in the normal population is 2-3 %. </p>
                        <p>In IVF babies the birth defect rate may be 2.6-3.9%. The difference is seen predominately in singleton males.</p>
                        <p>Studies to date have not been large enough to prove a link between IVF treatment and specific types of birth defects.</p> 
                        <p><strong>Imprinting Disorders.</strong> These are rare disorders having to do with whether a maternal or paternal gene is inappropriately expressed.   In two studies approximately 4% of children with the imprinting disorder called <u>Beckwith-Weidemann Syndrome</u> were born after IVF, which is more than expected. A large Danish study however found <u>no increased risk</u> of imprinting disorders in children conceived with the assistance of IVF. Since the incidence of this syndrome in the general population is 1/15,000, even if there is a 2 to 5-fold increase to 2-5/15,000, this absolute risk is <u>very low</u>.</p> 
                        <p><strong>Childhood Cancers.</strong> Most studies have not reported an increased risk with the exception of <u>retinoblastoma</u>: In one study in the Netherlands, five cases were reported after IVF treatment which is 5 to 7 times more than expected.</p>
                        <p><strong>Infant Development.</strong> In general, studies of long-term developmental outcomes have been reassuring so far; most children are doing well.  However, these studies are difficult to do and suffer from limitations.  A more recent study with better methodology reported an increased risk of cerebral palsy (3.7 fold) and developmental delay (4 fold), but most of this stemmed from the <u>prematurity</u> and <u>low birth weight</u> that was a consequence of multiple pregnancy.</p>
