<h1>Donated or Research Embryo Fate</h1>
<p>In certain situations, donating embryo(s) may not be possible or may be restricted by law. While efforts will be made to abide by your wishes, no guarantees can be given that embryo(s) will be used to donate to another couple. In these instances, if after two years no recipient can be found, or your embryos are not eligible, your embryo(s) will be discarded by the lab in accordance with laboratory procedures and applicable laws.</p>
<p>In certain situations, donating embryo(s) for research may not be possible or may be restricted by law. It will be your responsibility to identify a research group willing to accept your embryos for donation to research. If you identify a research program, it is our/my responsibility to arrange for transfer of our/my embryos to the research facility. We/I also understand that we/I will be responsible for storage fees until the transfer of our/my embryos has been completed.</p>
