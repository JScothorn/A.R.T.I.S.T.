<h1>Embryo Disposition</h1>
<p>Freezing of viable embryos not transferred after egg retrieval provides additional chances for pregnancy</p>
<p>Frozen embryos do not always survive the process of freezing and thawing</p>
<p>Freezing of eggs before fertilization is currently much less successful than freezing of fertilized eggs (embryos)</p>
<p>Ethical and legal dilemmas can arise when couples separate or divorce; disposition agreements are essential</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of each couple with frozen embryos to remain in contact with WSP on quarterly basis</p>
