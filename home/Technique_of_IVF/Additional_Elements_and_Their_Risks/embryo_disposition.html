<h1>Embryo Disposition</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Cryopreservation
		<ul>
			<li>Description/purpose:
				<li>Freezing (or “cryopreservation”) of embryos is a common procedure.  Since multiple eggs (oocytes) are often produced during ovarian stimulation, on occasion there are more embryos available than are considered appropriate for transfer to the uterus. These embryos, if viable, can be frozen for future use</li>
			</li>
			<li>Summary of Indications:
				<ul>
					<li>To reduce the risks of multiple gestation</li>
					<li>To preserve fertility potential in the face of certain necessary medical procedures</li>
					<li>To increase the chance of having one or more pregnancies from a single cycle of ovarian stimulation</li>
					<li>To minimize the medical risk and cost to the patient by decreasing the number of stimulated cycles and egg retrievals</li>
					<li>To temporarily delay pregnancy and the risks of OHSS (link to OHSS) occurs by freezing all embryos, when this risk is high</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Techniques:
				<ul>
					<li>Traditional methods include “slow,” graduated freezing in a computerized setting, and “rapid” freezing methods, called “vitrification.”</li>
					<li>Current techniques deliver a high percentage of viable embryos thawed after cryopreservation, but there can be no certainty that embryos will thaw normally, nor be viable enough to divide and eventually implant in the uterus</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Risks:
				<ul>
					<li>Overall pregnancy rates at the national level with frozen embryos are lower than with fresh embryos.  This, at least in part, results from the routine selection of the best-looking embryos for fresh transfer, reserving the remaining ('second-best') embryos for freezing.  There is some evidence that pregnancy rates are similar when there is no such selection</li>
					<li>Extensive animal data (through several generations), and limited human data, do not indicate any likelihood that children born of embryos that have been cryopreserved and thawed will experience greater risk of abnormalities than those born of fresh embryos.  However, until very large numbers of children have been born following freezing and thawing of embryos, it is not possible to be certain that the rate of abnormalities is no different from the normal rate.</li>

	<li>Legal Decisions
		<ul>
			<li>Because of the possibility of you and/or your partner’s separation, death or incapacitation, it is important to decide on the disposition of any embryo(s), fresh or cryopreserved that remain in the laboratory. Since this is a rapidly evolving field, both medically and legally, ARI cannot guarantee what the available or acceptable avenues for disposition will be at any future date</li>
			<li>Alternatives:
				<ul>
					<li>Discarding the cryopreserved embryo(s)</li>
					<li>Donating the cryopreserved embryo(s) for approved research studies</li>
					<li>Donating the cryopreserved embryos to another couple in order to attempt pregnancy (You may be asked to undergo additional infectious disease testing and screening recommended by the FDA if you select this option.)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Embryos are understood to be your property, with rights of surviorship. No use can be made of these embryos without the consent of both partners (if applicable)
				<ul>
					<li>In the event of divorce or dissolution of the marriage or partnership, the ownership and/or other rights to the embryo(s) will be as directed by the court decree and/or settlement agreement</li>
					<li>In the event of the death or incapacitation of one partner, the embryo(s) will become the sole and exclusive property of the surviving partner</li>
					<li>In the event of death or incapacitation of both partners or of a last surviving partner, the embryo(s) shall become the sole and exclusive property of ARI. In this event, I/we elect to: (please select and initial your choice) 1. Insert chart</li>
