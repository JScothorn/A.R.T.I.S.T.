			        			<li>Lack of sperm in ejaculate caused by failure of testes to produce sperm</li>
			        			<li>Can be due to a number of reasons:

			        					<li>Prior radiation</li>
			        					<li>Chemotherapy</li>
			        					<li>Undescended testicles</li>
			        					<li>Small deletions on Y chromosome (link to genetic related risks, Sex chromosome abnormalities, 3)</li>

			  <li>This technique overcomes semen and/or sperm abnormalities by bypassing the shell around the egg (zona pellucida) and the egg membrane (oolemma) to deliver the sperm directly into the egg</li>

	<li>Procedure
		<ul>
			<li>ICSI involves the direct injection of a single sperm into the interior of an egg using an extremely thin glass needle</li>

			        Reports on the risk of birth defects associated with ICSI have yielded conflicting results
			      </a>
			    </div>
			<div id="collapseRisk" class="accordion-body collapse">
				<div class="accordion-inner">
				<ul>
					<li>The most comprehensive study conducted thus far has suggested that ICSI may be associated with an increased risk of certain major congenital abnormalities (4.2% versus ~3% of those conceived naturally. However, whether this association is due to the ICSI procedure itself, or to inherent sperm defects, could not be determined because the study did not distinguish between male factor conditions and other causes of infertility</li>
					<li>An early report on ICSI suggested that such children lagged significantly in intellectual and motor development compared to children resulting from conventional IVF or those conceived naturally. However, more recent studies from larger groups, using standardized criteria for evaluation, have not detected any differences in the development or abilities of children born after ICSI, conventional IVF, or natural conception.</li>
				</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Sex Chromosome Abnormalities
				<ul>
					<li>Prevalence is slightly higher in children conceived via ICSI than is observed in the general IVF population (0.8% to 1.0% in ICSI offspring versus 0.2% in the general IVF population)</li>
					<li>May reflect a direct paternal effect
						<ul>
							<li>Men with sperm problems are more likely themselves to have genetic abnormalities and often produce sperm with abnormal chromosomes, especially the sex chromosomes (X and Y), which are likely to be passed to offspring</li>
							<li>The prevalence of translocations (a re-arrangement of chromosomes that increases the risk of abnormal chromosomes in egg or sperm and can cause miscarriage) of paternal origin and of de novo balanced translocations in ICSI offspring (0.36%) also appears high than in the general population (0.07%)</li>
							<li>Men with sperm containing a Y chromosomal microdeletion will transmit this mutation to the offspring. Thus the risk that male offspring might later manifest disorders including infertility is very real. However, men without a detectable deletion by blood testing can generate offspring having a Y chromosome microdeletion, because the chromosomes in the sperm may not be the same as those seen when tested by a blood test.</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>CBAVD and CF
				<ul>
					<li>Men with CBAVD are affected with a mild form of cystic fibrosis (CF), and this gene will be passed on to their offspring</li>
					<li>All men with CVABD, as well as their partners, should be tested for CF gene mutations prior to treatment, so that the risk of their offspring having CF can be estimated and appropriate testing performed</li>
					<li>It is important to understand that there may be CF gene mutations that are not detectable by current testing and parents who test negative for CF mutations can still have children affected with CF</li>
