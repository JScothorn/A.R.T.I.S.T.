<h1>Legal Considerations to Offspring</h1>
<p>The law regarding embryo cryopreservation, subsequent thaw and use, and parent-child status of any resulting child(ren) is, or may be, unsettled in the state in which either the patient, spouse, partner, or any donor currently or in the future lives, or the state in which the ART Program is located.  We/I acknowledge that the ART Program has not given us legal advice, that we are not relying on the ART Program to give us any legal advice, and that we have been informed that we may wish to <strong>consult a lawyer</strong> who is experienced in the areas of <strong>reproductive law</strong> and embryo cryopreservation and disposition. If we/I have any questions or concerns about the present or future status of our embryos, our/my individual or joint access to them, our/my individual or joint parental status as to any resulting child, or about any other aspect of this consent and agreement.</p>
