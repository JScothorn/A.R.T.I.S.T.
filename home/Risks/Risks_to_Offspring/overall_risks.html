<h1>Overall Risks</h1>
<p>Since the first birth of an IVF baby in 1978, more than 3 million children have been born worldwide following IVF treatments.  Numerous studies have been conducted to assess the overall health of IVF children and the majority of studies on the safety of IVF have been reassuring. As more time has passed and the dataset has enlarged, some studies have raised doubts about the equivalence of risks for IVF babies as compared to naturally conceived babies. </p>
<p>A major problem in interpreting the data arises from the fact that comparing a group of infertile couples to a group of normally fertile couples is not the proper comparison to make if one wants to assess the risk that IVF technology engenders. Infertile couples, by definition, do not have normal reproductive function and might be expected to have babies with more abnormalities than a group of normally fertile couples.   This said, even if the studies suggesting an increased risk to babies born after IVF prove to be true, <u>the absolute risk of any abnormal outcome appears to be small</u>.</p
