<h1>Risks of Pregnancy</h1>
<p>Pregnancies that occur with IVF are associated risks with increased risks of certain conditions</p> 
<p>Some of these risks stem from the higher average age of women pregnant by IVF and the fact that underlying cause of infertility may be the cause of the increased risk of pregnancy complications</p>

<p><br>Absolute risk = % IVF Pregnancies in which risk occurred</p>
<p>Relative risk = risk in IVF versus risk in non-IVF pregnancies (ex: Relative risk of 2.0 indicates that twice as many IVF pregnancies experience this risk as compared to non-IVF pregnancies. </p>
