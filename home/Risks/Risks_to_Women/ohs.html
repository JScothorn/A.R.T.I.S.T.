<h1>Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome</h1>
<p>To increase the number of eggs that develop, a series of hormone shots are given over two to four weeks. The hormones used in this regimen are known to have, or suspected of having a variety of side effects, some minor and some potentially major.</p>
<p>The most serious side effect of ovarian stimulation is ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).</p>
<P>Symptoms can include: <strong>increased ovarian size, nausea and vomiting, accumulation of fluid in the abdomen</strong>, breathing difficulties, an increasing concentration of red blood cells, kidney and liver problems, and in the most severe cases, blood cots, <strong>kidney failure</strong>, or death.</P> 
<p>Severe cases affect only a very small percentage of women who undergo OI-IUI – 0.2% or less of all treatment cycles – very severe are even a smaller percentage.</p>
<p>Only about 1.4 in 100,000 cycles has lead to kidney failure, or death.</p> 
<p>OHSS occurs at 2 stages:
    <ul>
        <li>Early, 1 to 5 days after your hCG-Ovidrel trigger</li>
        <li>Late, 10 to 15 days after your hCG-Ovidrel trigger</li>
    </ul>
