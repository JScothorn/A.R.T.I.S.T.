<h1>Alternatives to IVF</h1>
<p>There are alternatives to IVF treatment including gamete Intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT) or tubal embryo transfer (TET) where eggs and sperm, fertilized eggs (ZIFT) or developing embryos, respectively, are placed into the fallopian tube(s). Using donor sperm, donor eggs, adoption or not pursuing treatment are also options. Gametes (sperm and/or eggs),Â instead of embryos may be frozen for future attempts at pregnancy in an effort to avoid potential future legal issues relating to disposition of any cryopreserved embryos. Sperm freezing, but not egg freezing, has been an established procedure for many decades. Egg freezing is currently available, but is considered an experimental procedure at this time (January 2009).</p>
