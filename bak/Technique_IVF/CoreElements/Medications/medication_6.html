<h1>Progesterone and estradiol</h1>
<p>Progesterone and estradiol are hormones normally produced by the ovaries after ovulation.After egg retrieval in some women, the ovaries will not produce adequate amounts of these hormones for long enough to fully support a pregnancy.  Accordingly, supplemental progesterone, and in some cases estradiol, are given to ensure adequate hormonal support of the uterine lining.  Progesterone is usually given by injection or by the vaginal route after egg retrieval.  Progesterone is often continued for some weeks after a pregnancy has been confirmed.  Progesterone has not been associated with an increase in fetal abnormalities. Side effects of progesterone include depression, sleepiness, allergic reaction and if given by intra-muscular injection includes the additional risk of infection or pain at the application site. Estradiol, if given, can be by oral, trans-dermal, intramuscular, or vaginal administration. Side effects of estradiol include nausea, irritation at the injection site if given by the trans-dermal route and the risk of blood clots or stroke.</p>
