<h1>Gonadotropins(injectable “fertility drugs”)</h1>
<p>These hormones stimulate the ovary in hopes of inducing the simultaneous growth of several oocytes (eggs) over the span of 8 or more days.  All injectable fertility drugs have FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), a hormone that will stimulate the growth of your ovarian follicles (which contain the eggs).  Some of them also contain LH (luteinizing hormone) or LH like activity. LH is a hormone that may work with FSH to increase the production of estrogen and growth of the follicles.  Luveris®, recombinant LH, can also be given as a separate injection in addition to FSH or alternatively, low-dose hCG can be used. These medications are given by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.  Proper dosage of these drugs and the appropriate timing of triggering ovulation require monitoring of the ovarian response, usually by way of blood tests and ultrasound examinations during the ovarian stimulation.</p>
<p>As with all injectable medications, bruising, redness, swelling, or discomfort can occur at the injection site.  Rarely, there can be there an allergic reaction to these drugs.  The intent of giving these medications is to mature multiple follicles, and many women experience some bloating and minor discomfort as the follicles grow and the ovaries become temporarily enlarged.  Up to 2.0 % of women will develop Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS).  Other risks and side effects of gonadotropins include, but are not limited to, fatigue, headaches, weight gain, mood swings, nausea, and clots in blood vessels.</p>
<p>Even with pre-treatment attempts to assess ovarian response including abnormal pre-treatment evaluations of ovarian reserve, the stimulation may result in very few follicles developing where the end result may be few or no eggs obtained at egg retrieval or even cancellation of the treatment cycle prior to egg retrieval. 
Some research has suggested that the risk of ovarian tumors may increase in women who take any fertility drugs over a long period of time.  These studies had significant flaws which limited the strength of the conclusions.   More recent studies have not confirmed this risk.</p>
<p>A major risk factor for ovarian cancer is infertility per se, suggesting that early reports may have falsely attributed the risk resulting from infertility to the use of medications to overcome it.  In these studies, conception lowered the risk of ovarian tumors to that of fertile women. </p>
