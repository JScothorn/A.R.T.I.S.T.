<h1>Technique in IVF</h1>
<p>In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) has become an established treatment for many forms of infertility. The main goal of IVF is to allow a patient the opportunity to become pregnant using her own eggs and sperm from her partner or from a donor. This is an elective procedure designed to result in the patient’s pregnancy when other treatments have failed or are not appropriate.</p>
<p>This consent reviews the IVF process from start to finish, including the risks that this treatment might pose to you and your offspring. While best efforts have been made to disclose all known risks, there may be risks of IVF which are not yet clarified or even suspected at the time of this writing.</p>
<p>IVF Cycle:<br>
An IVF cycle typically includes the following steps or procedures:
    <ul>
        <li>Medications to grow multiple eggs</li>
        <li>Retrieval of eggs from the ovary or ovaries</li>
        <li>Insemination of eggs with sperm</li>
        <li>Culture of any resulting fertilized eggs (embryo)</li>
        <li>Placement (“transfer”) of one or more embryo(s) into the uterus</li>
        <li>Support of the uterine lining with hormones to permit and sustain pregnancy​</li>
        </ul>
</p>
<p>In certain cases, these additional procedures can be employed:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to increase chance for fertilization</li>
        <li>Assisted hatching of embryos to increase the chance of embryo attachment (“implantation”)</li>
        <li>Embryo Cryopreservation (freezing)</li>
    </ul>
