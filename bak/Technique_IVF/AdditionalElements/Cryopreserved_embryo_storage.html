<h1>Cryopreserved Embryo Storage</h1>
<p>WSP will only maintain cryopreserved embryos for a period of five years. After that time, any cryopreserved embryos must be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Thawed for Frozen Embryo Transfer</li>
    <li>Donated to another couple</li>
    <li>Donated to research</li>
    <li>Discarded</li>
    <li>Transferred to a long-term storage facility</li>
</ul>
<p>There are fees associated with freezing and maintaining cryopreserved embryo(s).</p>
<p>Patients/couples must remain in contact with WSP on a quarterly basis in order to inform the clinic of their wishes as well as to pay the fees associated with the storage of their embryo(s).</p>
<p>In situations where there is no contact with WSP for a period of one year or fees associated with embryo storage have not been paid for a period of one year and WSP is unable to contact me/us at the last given address and phone number, the embryo(s) will be considered to be abandoned and may be discarded by WSP in accordance with normal laboratory procedures and applicable law.</p>
