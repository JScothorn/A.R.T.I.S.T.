<h1>The Option of Selective Reduction</h1>
<p>Pregnancies that have more than 2 fetuses are considered an adverse outcome of infertility treatment. The greater the number of fetuses within the uterus, the greater is the risk for adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes. Patients with more than twins are faced with the options of continuing the pregnancy with all risks previously described, terminating the entire pregnancy, or reducing the number of fetuses in an effort to decrease the risk of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Multifetal pregnancy reduction (MFPR) decreases risks associated with preterm delivery, but often creates profound ethical dilemmas. Pregnancy loss is the main risk of MFPR. However, current data suggest that such complications have decreased as experience with the procedure has grown. <strong>The risk of loss of the entire pregnancy after MFPR is approximately 1% to 5%.</strong></p>
