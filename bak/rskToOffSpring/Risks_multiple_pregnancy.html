<h1>Risks of Multiple Pregnancy</h1>
<p>Multiple fetuses (including twins) that share the same placenta have additional risks. <u>Twin-twin transfusion syndrome</u> in which there is an imbalance of circulation between the fetuses may occur in up to 20% of twins sharing a placenta.  Excess or insufficient amniotic fluid may result from twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.  Twins sharing the same placenta have a higher frequency of birth defects compared to pregnancies having two placentas.  Twins sharing the same placenta appear to occur more frequently after blastocyst transfer.</p>
<p>Placenta previa and vasa previa are more common complications in multiple gestations. Abruptio placenta also is more common and postpartum hemorrhage may complicate 12% of multifetal deliveries. Consequences of multiple gestations include the major sequelae of prematurity (cerebral palsy, retinopathy of prematurity, and chronic lung disease) as well as those of fetal growth restriction (polycythemia, hypoglycemia, necrotizing enterocolitis). It is unclear to what extent multiple gestations themselves affect neuro-behavioral development in the absence of these complications. Rearing of twins and high-order multiples may generate <u>physical, emotional, and financial stresses</u>, and the incidence of <u>maternal depression and anxiety</u> is increased in women raising multiples. At mid-childhood, prematurely born offspring from multiple gestations <u>have lower IQ scores</u>, and multiple birth children have an <u>increase in behavioral problems</u> compared with singletons.  It is not clear to what extent these risks are affected by IVF.</p>
