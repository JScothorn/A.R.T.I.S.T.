<h1>Reporting Outcomes</h1>
<p><strong>The 1992 Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act</strong> requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to collect <strong>cycle-specific data</strong> as well as <strong>pregnancy outcome</strong> on all assisted reproductive technology cycles performed in the United States each year and requires them to report <strong>success rates</strong> using these data.  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Consequently, data from my/our IVF procedure will be provided to the CDC, and to the Society of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART) of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) (if my/our clinic is a member of this organization).</li>
    <li>The CDC may request additional information from the treatment center or contact me/us directly for additional follow-up. </li>
    <li>Additionally, my/our information may be used and disclosed in accordance with HIPAA guidelines in order to perform research or quality control. All information used for research will be <strong>de-identified</strong> prior to publication. De-identification is a process intended to prevent the data associated with my/our treatment being used to identify me/us as individuals. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, ARI physicians and scientists may include information about IVF procedures in medical publications and professional presentations.  In these publications and presentations the identities of the patients involved in the IVF procedure remain confidential.  ARI keeps patient medical records and information confidential through standard procedures for the protection of patient identities.</p>
