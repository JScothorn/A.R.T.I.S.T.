<h1>Psychosocial Effects of Infertility Treatment</h1>
<p>A diagnosis of infertility can be a devastating and life-altering event that impacts many aspects of a patient’s life. Infertility and its treatment can affect a patient and her spouse or partner medically, financially, socially, emotionally and psychologically. Feelings of anxiousness, depression, isolation, and helplessness are not uncommon among patients undergoing infertility treatment. Strained and stressful relations with spouses, partners and other loved ones are not uncommon as treatment gets underway and progresses.</p>
<p>Our health care team is available to address the emotional, as well as physical symptoms that can accompany infertility. In addition to working with our health care team to minimize the emotional impacts of infertility treatments, patients may also consider working with mental health professionals who are specially trained in the area of infertility care. </p>
<p>Our health care team can assist you in locating a qualified mental health professional who is familiar with the emotional experience of infertility, or you can contact a national support group such as RESOLVE, (<a href="http://www.resolve.org">www.resolve.org</a>, Tel. 1-888-623-0744) or The American Fertility Association (AFA), (<a href="http://www.theafa.org">www.theafa.org</a>, Tel: 1-888-917-3777). </p>
