<h1>Ethical and Religious Considerations in Infertility Treatment</h1>
<p>Infertility treatment can raise concerns and questions of an ethical or religious nature for some patients. The technique of in vitro fertilization (IVF) involves the creation of human embryos outside the body, and can involve the production of excess embryos and/or “high-order” multiple pregnancy (triplets or more).</p> 
<p>We encourage patients and their spouses or partners who so desire to consult with trusted members of their religious or ethics community for guidance on their infertility treatment.</p>
