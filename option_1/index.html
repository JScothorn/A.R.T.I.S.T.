                The success of ivf largely depends on growing multiple eggs at once. Injections of the natural hormones fsh and/or lh (gonadotropins) are used for this purpose. Additional medications are used to prevent premature ovulation. An ovrly vigorous response can occur, or conversely an inadequate response.

                        Many treatment protocols include oral contraceptive pills to be taken for 2 to 4 weeks or estradiol one to 4 weeks before gonadotropin injections are started in order to suppress hormone or to schedule a cycle. Estrace sometimes administered after ovulation prior to your menses, it is possible that it could be taken early in pregnancy. Safest course of action is to use a barrier method of contraception (condoms) the month you start estrace.

                    <p>
                        Women undergoing ICSI are given reproductive hormones to encourage several eggs to develop in the ovaries.  The eggs are then removed from the ovaries in a short outpatient procedure. Fertilization is achieved through the direct injection of a single sperm into the interior of an egg using an extremely thin glass needle

                        Birth Defect Risks

                    <p>
                       Reports on the risk of birth defects (link to Risks to Offspring, Birth Defects) associated with ICSI have yielded conflicting results
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most comprehensive study conducted thus far has suggested that ICSI may be associated with an increased risk of certain major congenital abnormalities (4.2% versus ~3% of those conceived naturally. However, whether this association is due to the ICSI procedure itself, or to inherent sperm defects, could not be determined because the study did not distinguish between male factor conditions and other causes of infertility
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An early report on ICSI suggested that such children lagged significantly in intellectual and motor development compared to children resulting from conventional IVF or those conceived naturally. However, more recent studies from larger groups, using standardized criteria for evaluation, have not detected any differences in the development or abilities of children born after ICSI, conventional IVF, or natural conception.

                                            Men with sperm containing a Y chromosomal microdeletion will transmit this mutation to the offspring. Thus the risk that male offspring might later manifest disorders including infertility is very real. However, men without a detectable deletion by blood testing can generate offspring having a Y chromosome microdeletion, because the chromosomes in the sperm may not be the same as those seen when tested by a blood test.

                Freezing of viable embryos not transferred after egg retrieval procides additional changes for pregnancy. Frozen embryos do not always survive the process of freezing and thawing. freezing egs before fertilization is currently much less successful than freezing of fertilized eggs (embryos). Ethical and legal dilemmas can arise when couples separate or divorce; disposition agrements are essential. It is the responsibility of each couple with frozen embryoes to remain in contact with ari on quarterly basis.

                Freezing (or “cryopreservation”) of embryos is a common procedure.  Since multiple eggs (oocytes) are often produced during ovarian stimulation, on occasion there are more embryos available than are considered appropriate for transfer to the uterus. These embryos, if viable, can be frozen for future use - shorten

                        Overall pregnancy rates at the national level with frozen embryos are lower than with fresh embryos.  This, at least in part, results from the routine selection of the best-looking embryos for fresh transfer, reserving the remaining ('second-best') embryos for freezing.  There is some evidence that pregnancy rates are similar when there is no such selection

                        Extensive animal data (through several generations), and limited human data, do not indicate any likelihood that children born of embryos that have been cryopreserved and thawed will experience greater risk of abnormalities than those born of fresh embryos.  However, until very large numbers of children have been born following freezing and thawing of embryos, it is not possible to be certain that the rate of abnormalities is no different from the normal rate.

                                                        The risk of severe complications is about 4 to 12 times higher if pregnancy occurs which is why sometimes hCG-Ovidrel trigger is withheld to reduce the possibility of this occurring.

                                    Many have worried that the use of fertility drugs could lead to an increased risk of cancer—in particular, breast, ovarian, and uterine (including endometrial) cancers. One must be careful in interpreting epidemiological studies of women taking fertility drugs, because all of these cancers are more common in women with infertility, #12 so merely comparing women taking fertility drugs with women in the general population inevitably shows an increased incidence of cancer. When the analysis takes into account the increased cancer risk due to infertility per se, the evidence does not support a relationship between fertility drugs and an increased prevalence of breast or ovarian cancer. More research is required to examine what the long-term impact fertility drugs may be on breast and ovarian cancer prevalence rates. For uterine cancer, while numbers are too small to achieve statistical significance, it is at least possible that use of fertility drugs may indeed cause some increased risk

                                        Pregnancies that occur with IVF are associated with increased risks of certain conditions (see Table below from the Executive Summary of a National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Workshop held in September 2005, as reported in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, vol. 109, no. 4, pages 967-77, 2007).

                                                Some of these risks stem from the higher average age of women pregnant by IVF and the fact that the underlying cause of infertility may be the cause of the increased risk of pregnancy complications

                Ethical and Religious Considerations in Infertility Treatment
            </h4>
            <p>
                IVF involves creating human embryos outside the body. IVF can involve the production of excess embryos and/or “high-order” multiple pregnancies (triplets +). We encourage patients and partners who desire to consult with their religious or ethical community for guidance on their treatment

                Psychosocial Effects of Infertility Treatment
            </h4>
            <p>
                A diagnosis of infertility can be a devastating and life-altering event. Infertility and its treatment can affect a patient and her partner medically, financially, socially, emotionally and psychologically. Feelings of anxiousness, depression, isolation, and helplessness are not uncommon among patients undergoing treatment. Strained and stressful relations with partners and other loved ones are not uncommon as treatment progresses. Our healthcare team is available to address emotional and physical symptoms that can accompany infertility. In addition to working with our health care team to minimize emotional impacts, patients may consider working with mental health professionals specializing in infertility care.

                While it is normal to experience emotional ups and downs, it is important to recognize severe feelings. If you experience any of the following for a prolonged period of time, you may benefit from working with a mental health professional [LINK TO Our health care team can assist you in locating a qualified mental health professional who is familiar with the emotional experience of infertility, or you can contact a national support group such as RESOLVE, (www.resolve.org, Tel. 1-888-623-0744) or The American Fertility Association (AFA), (www.theafa.org, Tel: 1-888-917-3777).

            </h4>
            <p>
                The 1992 Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to collect cycle-specific data as well as pregnancy outcome on all assisted reproductive technology cycles performed in the United States each year and requires them to report success rates using these data.  Consequently, data from my/our IVF procedure will be provided to the CDC, and to the Society of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART) of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) (if my/our clinic is a member of this organization). The CDC may request additional information from the treatment center or contact me/us directly for additional follow-up. Additionally, my/our information may be used and disclosed in accordance with HIPAA guidelines in order to perform research or quality control. All information used for research will be de-identified prior to publication. De-identification is a process intended to prevent the data associated with my/our treatment being used to identify me/us as individuals. #2 needs shortened
